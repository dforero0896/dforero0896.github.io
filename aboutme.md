title: About me
---

I am Daniel Forero, physicist and geoscientist. I am passionate about Physics, Cosmology, and scientific computing. I am particularly interested in the application of Machine Learning/Deep Learning developments to Science.

I am currently an Astrophysics PhD student at EPFL, where I work on Cosmological/Large-Scale-Structure studies using 3D galaxy surveys (i.e. DESI). I am interested in cosmological measurements with cosmic voids and in improving the quality/computational-cost rapport of N-body simulations for LSS studies.
